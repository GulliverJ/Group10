				<p>The vehicular population of London is well known to be inconveniently large for the space available on our roads. Consequently, the difficulties involved in finding space to park - either regularly or short-term - result in widespread issues of illegal parking. Councils across the city take in tens of millions of pounds each year from parking fines - in 2012, Westminster alone brought in £37.1 million. Our client is investigating ways in which to cut that figure down through the implementation of an intelligent parking analysis system.</p>

<p>We have been challenged to assist with the research by exploring ways in which to build a network of road-side sensors. Through data analytics, this network can provide real-time information about the state of parking bays spread across the city - whether or not they're occupied, how long they've been occupied for, and more. With the growing social motivation to develop the Internet of Things on a city scale, we will develop an API that will allow developers to access the data and integrate it into more intelligent apps that meet new demands.</p>

<p>The parking data system will cater for the needs of many groups. Residents and visitors to London could benefit greatly - a simple glance at an app could direct them to the nearest free, legal parking space, and notifications can remind them when their time limit nears. In addition, councils could potentially use the system for both analytics and upholding parking restrictions, with traffic wardens interacting with the data whilst on patrol.</p>

<p>As an added dimension, the sensor network should also provide the opportunity to expand indefinitely; to connect various types of sensors and aggregate the raw data for new interpretations and applications. For example, pollution sensors may be coupled with the parking network data, or weather sensors in order to draw new conclusions or satisfy unseen demands. Our system will lay the foundations for the population of London to start living more connected lives.

				<p>Driving the project is Orange Labs, the research and development branch of the Orange telecommunications corporation. Their research informs a large part of what Orange currently offers - in particular, their focus rests on innovation and the Internet of Things. Cloud storage and access to broad data networks are becoming some of Orange’s priority products, and their desire to expand their range of applications is evident in our project. By working closely with our clients, we benefit from access an array of cutting-edge technologies, allowing us to work towards developing an exciting and innovative new product.</p>
