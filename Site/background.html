				<p>The vehicular population of London is well known to be inconveniently large for the space available on our roads. Consequently, the difficulties involved in finding space to park - either regularly or short-term - result in widespread issues of illegal parking. Councils across the city take in tens of millions of pounds each year from parking fines - in 2012, Westminster alone brought in £37.1 million. Our client is investigating ways in which to cut that figure down through the implementation of an intelligent parking analysis system.</p>

<p>We have been challenged to assist with the research by exploring ways in which to build a network of road-side sensors. Through data analytics, this network can provide real-time information about the state of parking bays spread across the city - whether or not they're occupied, how long they've been occupied for, and more. With the growing social motivation to develop the Internet of Things on a city scale, we will develop an API that will allow developers to access the data and integrate it into more intelligent apps that meet new demands.</p>

<p>The parking data system will cater for the needs of many groups. Residents and visitors to London could benefit greatly - a simple glance at an app could direct them to the nearest free, legal parking space, and notifications can remind them when their time limit nears. In addition, councils could potentially use the system for both analytics and upholding parking restrictions, with traffic wardens interacting with the data whilst on patrol.</p>

<p>As an added dimension, the sensor network should also provide the opportunity to expand indefinitely; to connect various types of sensors and aggregate the raw data for new interpretations and applications. For example, pollution sensors may be coupled with the parking network data, or weather sensors in order to draw new conclusions or satisfy unseen demands. Our system will lay the foundations for the population of London to start living more connected lives.

				<p>Driving the project is Orange Labs, the research and development branch of the Orange telecommunications corporation. Their research informs a large part of what Orange currently offers - in particular, their focus rests on innovation and the Internet of Things. Cloud storage and access to broad data networks are becoming some of Orange’s priority products, and their desire to expand their range of applications is evident in our project. By working closely with our clients, we benefit from access an array of cutting-edge technologies, allowing us to work towards developing an exciting and innovative new product.</p>

				By abstracting much of the layers of detail from our project, the full scope of the system we aim to build can be said to comprise of three main sections: 
					<ol>
						<li>Creating a small-scale sensor network to represent a city-scale implementation</li>
						<li>Carrying out Data Analytics on the 'raw data' collected and stored from the sensor network - then producing a set of APIs which provides access to this information</li>
						<li>Creating a front-end web interface that enables the monitoring of all sensors involved in the network</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					As previously stated, this project indeed has further reaching aims of providing an open platform over which sensor data can be manipulated and new sensors can be integrated, in order to demonstrate this architecture, we will be working on a sub-set of this, the use case of 'parking / illegal parking'.   
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of the criteria for success, it should be noted that emphasis was placed on the need to create an open architecture that could be built upon in the future by the client along with an interest in the data analytics produced. Ideally they wish for a platform over which they can use for experimental purposes. As such, being able to demonstrate, through the set of APIs built and the GUI that our use case is fully functional, would reflect the underlining workings of the architecture, and through this – enable the created system to be considered a success.
