			<p><h1>Network architecture Considerations (make into picture)</h1></p>
			<p><h1>Ways to send data</h1></p>
			<p>There are many different ways to send data both wirelessly and wired. Through extensive research we narrowed it down to a few different ways.</p>
			<p><h2>WiFi</h2></p>
			<p>WiFi is a wireless technology that allows devices to connect to the Internet. 
			It uses the IEEE 802.11 protocol standards to transmit data. 
			The advantage of using a network like this one, is that it gives access to the Internet. This means that there is virtually no limit to the range of our devices.
			The drawback of using WiFi is that it uses far more power than most other devices and would therefore not be suitable unless a sustainable power supply is provided.
			Since our sensors will be placed on roads with no easy access electricity, Wifi will most likely not be the best way to transmit data. 
			One way WiFi will be useful however, is as a zone controller. All the data thats being transmitted between sensors can only send it to a local network, however WiFi will allow us to take that data and upload it to the internet.
			The zone controller does not need to be placed on the road and can therefore be placed near a power supply along the street. </p>
			<p><h2>Bluetooth</h2></p>
			<p>Bluetooth is another way to transmit data wirelessly. Bluetooth uses short wavelength UHF radio waves to transmit its data and is used for local networks. 
			Its physical range can vary from 1-100 meters with its power supply varying with that. 
			With the new Bluetooth 4.0, you are no longer limited to 8 devices, making it a possible data transmission technology for our use case. 
			Its data rate is rather lower, but in our use case we are not transmitting large enough quantities of data for this to matter.</p>
			<p><h2>ZigBee</h2></p>
			<p>ZigBee is an alternative to Bluetooth, in that they serve similar roles. ZigBee is a low data rate, low power and lower range device designed for local networks.
			It uses less power than Bluetooth, but its range is also lower.</p>
			<p><h2>Using a Serial cable</h2></p>
			<p>Using a Serial cable is a wired way of transferring data across a network. An obvious downside to this is the fact that the devices will have to be connected together.
			If we decide to place our sensors on the actual parking bay, we would have to dig down these cables to to prevent them from being destroyed. This will drive up the cost of our system.
			In the cases where our sensors are not directly on the parking bay, using a cable can be beneficial. It is by far the most reliable way to send data, with a decent range.
			The range of cables vary with data rate as seen below:</p>
			<p><table> 
					<tr><th>Data Rate (bps) </th> 
						<th> Distance (m) </th>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>2400</td> 
						<td> 60 </td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>4800</td> 
						<td> 30</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>9600</td> 
						<td> 15</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>19200</td> 
						<td> 7.6</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>38400</td> 
						<td> 3.7</td>
					</tr>
					<tr><td>56000</td> 
						<td> 2.6</td>
					</tr>
			</table>
			</p>
			<p>As seen, the range is halved as the data rate is doubled.</p>
			<p><h2>Technical Data Comparison</h2></p>
			<p><table> 
					<tr><th></th> 
						<th> WiFi </th>
						<th> Bluetooth 4.0 </th>
						<th> Bluetooth 3.0</th> 	
						<th> ZigBee</th> 
						<th> Wired Connection</th> 
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Speed</td> 
						<td> Fast </td>
						<td> Slow </td>
						<td> Normal</td> 	
						<td> Slow</td> 
						<td> Fast</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Range</td> 
						<td> Unlimited</td>
						<td> ~100m </td>
						<td> &#60 100m</td> 	
						<td> 10-100m</td> 
						<td> 2.6-60m</td> 
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Number of devices</td> 
						<td> Wifi </td>
						<td> Bluetooth 4.0 </td>
						<td> Bluetooth 3.0</td> 	
						<td> ZigBee</td> 
						<td> Unlimited </td> 
					</tr>
					<tr><td>Power Consumption</td> 
						<td> ~116ma </td>
						<td> &#60 30ma </td>
						<td> &#60 15ma</td> 	
						<td> &#60 9ma</td> 
						<td> Low</td> 
					</tr>
			</table>
			</p>	
			<p><h2>Final thoughts</h2></p>
			<p>Depending on the use case and kind of sensor we are working with, some protocols work better than other. 
			For our parking bay monitoring case we would use ZigBee for the wireless datatransmission, but we may decide to use wired if we use something like infrared.
			We chose ZigBee over Bluetooth, because the range did not matter in this case and the lower power consumption is more beneficial. </p>

				<p><h1>Potential sensors and their applications</h1></p>
				<p>This section details a variety of sensors and their potential use for object detection in relation to
				the use case of <b>'parking/illegal parking'</b>. What sensors we may use as hardware to support the use
				case, how these would be configured in different environments, considerations and lastly, the
				strengths and weaknesses associated with each have been documented below. </p>
				<p><h2>Approaches:</h2></p>
				<img src="img/greyrule.png"/>
				<p><span class="research">A</span> | Light sensors/ Photodiodes as a method of object detection</p>
				<img src="img/greydot.png"/>
				<p>By making use of these sensors, the general idea was to detect a 'spike' in the change of light
				intensity. One potential configuration for these sensors can be seen below: </p>
				<p><img src="img/ParkSensorUnderneath.png"></img></p>
				<p>Detecting the presence of a vehicle would then be a matter of a change in sensor readings from a
				high intensity to a low, indicating the sensor in question is covered by the shadow of a vehicle. </p>
				<p>This approach alone however, may only be suited for indoor parking where the light source would
				keep in near-constant levels, enough for a default state to be identified for 'bay unoccupied' which
				changes in light intensity could then be matched against. Experimentation would have to occur in
				order to test out how great the 'dip' from an object covering it from a range of specified heights
				(taking into account car height which is lower for sport cars and higher for vehicles like off roaders)
				and also the different width x lengths of said objects in order to determine whether this change is
				great enough for object detection. </p>
				<p>Depending upon their configuration in the environment of an indoor parking lot, the sensors could
				potentially indicate the parking over two spaces instead of one. This would, however, require having
				more sensors to be implemented. </p>
				<p><img src="img/configuration1.png" align="left" hspace=10/> One consideration to be made here, with the configuration seen left, would
				be whether one of the sensors placed between two parking bays is
				accidentally covered by the shadow of a car parked in only one of the two
				spaces resulting in a false reading of 'parking over two spaces'. This would
				depend on where the light source is and also the height of the car, making
				the extended detection of unethical parking unreliable and unfeasible. <br><br>Out-door parking making use of these sensors during day-time might be possible, however, as
				readings would be based upon the main light source of the sun, while gradual changes could be
				handled â€“ adjusting the sensors to sudden changes in weather and also keeping track of whether a
				vehicle is above it or not is probably not feasible.</p>					
				<p>Alternatively, a secondary option would be using photodiodes for generating power for other
				sensors instead. The key here would then be whether such a device could be powered solely by solar
				power removing the need of installing a battery. Experimentation would need to be done to find out
				how much power can be created using solar power sensors vs. how much the sensors we use
				require. If we find that we can produce more power than consumed, then this might be viable. </p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="research">B</span> | Multiple infra-red sensors for object detection </p>
				<img src="img/greydot.png"/>
				<p>One idea involves having a hose pipe with multiple, cheap IR sensors in it wired together and then
				fastening this to the side of a pavement/ wall instead of having separate sensor units. </p>
				<img src="img/pipe.png"/>
				<p>The range an infrared sensor can detect reliably can vary a lot. Ideally, a sensor that could read
				reliably at a range of at least 80cm would be a candidate for detecting the presence of a vehicle. The
				data transmitted would then be a 'YES/NO' binary signal based on whether the sensors' reading was
				maxed out 'space unoccupied' or not 'space occupied' rather than the distance from the sensor to
				the nearest object. </p>
				<p> possible configurations for these sensors can be seen below: </p>
				<p><img src="img/Parkconfiguration1.png" hspace=15 style="width:320px;height:389px"/><img src="img/Parkconfiguration2.png" align="right"  style="width:320px;height:240px"/></p>
				<p>As seen, there is both a sensor in the middle of the parking bay and one on each line between parking bays. 
				The ones in the middle are to simply detect if a car is occupying the bay or not. 
				The ones on the line are to monitor if a car is covering more than 1 parking bay and is therefore parked illegally.</p>

				<p><span class="research">C</span> | Ultrasound as an alternative to Infra-red</p>
				<img src="img/greydot.png"/>
				<p>There are some limitations with using Ultrasound. 
				If the object you are reflecting your sound wave off is at too wide of an angle, no sound wave will return to the device and a maxed out reading will be read.
				This limits the configurations of this kind of sensor as the following is not possible for ultrasound, but possible for Infrared:
				</p>
				<p><img src="img/ultrasoundangle.png" style="width:670px;"/></p>
				<p>Alternative options would include placing the sensor directly below the car as appears convention.
				Mounting the sensor units directly above car parking bays would work indoors as well. A kind of	
				lighting system may also be useful here, where motorists are indicated to which spaces are
				'occupied' or 'unoccupied' via the lights 'RED' or 'GREEN' respectively. </p>

				<p><span class="research">D</span> | Web camera</p>
				<img src="img/greydot.png"/>
				<p>Algorithms for motion-detection combined with the use of a web camera mounted on a street light
				for video capturing purposes was first considered. Given the high volume of data which would have
				to be captured, stored then processed and the costs this would incur however, short, sporadic
				capture every half-minute and analysing this data by way of setting up a â€˜black boxâ€™ that carries out
				calculations on the spot via machine learning was considered to have better potential. </p>
				
				<p>			
				     This method would require the least sensor units, making it cheaper for this reason. Units would, however, have to be installed at an appropriate height from the ground to prevent vandalism for instance. 
				</p>				
				
				<p>Again, how well this performs in the outdoor environment will have to be extensively tested.
				Creating an algorithm capable of detecting cars would be the main challenge. Considerations must
				be taken into how well such a sensor will perform under extreme weather conditions, light
				conditions and during the night (visibility issues). </p>

				<br>
				<p><span class="research">F</span> | Electromagnetic sensors / Inductive loops</p>
				<img src="img/greydot.png"/>
				<p>
					Another method considered was the use of inductive coils. The change in inductance when a vehicle passes over a coil is what is measured to determine the presence of an object. In this case, it is the steel frame of vehicles that is acting as a remote sensor and detected as an electromagnetic material.
				</p>
				<p>
					This method would involve placing the coils underground. Perhaps the greatest drawback of this method would be the fact that a large area would have to be cut into the ground to place these in and then sealed back up. There are costs associated with this and they cannot be instantly deployed. Ideally however, by following through with this, a long-lasting parking based sensor network can be built.
