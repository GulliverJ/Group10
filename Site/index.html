				<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>		
			With data.gov.uk going live in 2010, the UK is increasingly becoming a hub for Open Data of which the IT sector, in particular, has found roots in innovation. 
			Coupled with this is the emergence of smart city implementations across the board. With population projected to grow by one million people over the coming decade, London especially, is looking towards improving the quality of the city&#39s infrastructure to cope with its rising demands and challenges associated with the need for better, smarter, transport, healthcare, energy and waste management. 
		</p><p>
		
			To deal with these challenges, London now, more than ever, has quietly become a city of sensors.
	
			As part of this growing movement, an open-source medium over which developers can test out their own sensors and perhaps even deploy could help benefit multiple projects and use cases in the upcoming future &#151 allowing seamless collaboration. 
		</p>

				<h1>Project Description </h1>
		<p>
			Our project is carried out in conjunction with Orange Labs, who have asked us to investigate, design and develop ways to build a city-wide sensor network. This network will connect the urban sprawl, and provide real-time data of many types to developers and researchers worldwide through an API. 
		</p><p>
			In order to demonstrate such an architecture, we will be working specifically on the use case of  <strong>&#60</strong> Parking / illegal parking <strong>&#62</strong> in hopes to help improve the quality of council parking as well as potentially expanding this to provide additional information to help inform the council on ways to improve the lives of local residents.
