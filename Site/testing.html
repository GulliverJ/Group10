				<p><h1> Testing Hardware </h1></p>
				<p>Testing hardware is very different from testing software. 
				When testing hardware, the results may vary from device to device, while on software it should always act the same.
				The hardware tests we will have to do for our product can be split into two sections; Sensor accuracy and data transmission.
				</p>
				<p><h2> Sensor Accuracy </h2></p>
				<p>To improve the quality of our readings, it is important that we test our sensors exhaustively. 
				Some documentation already exists for certain sensors in terms of accuracy of sensors at different ranges. 
				In the prototype we used an SRF-05 Ultra-Sonic Ranger. Under its technical specifications, the following diagram was provided:
				</p>
				<p><img src="img/beam.gif"/> </p>
				<p>The diagram is of the ultra sound beam pattern created by the device. 
				As seen the device reads mostly what is straight in front of it, however it can accidentally pick up a reading of something slightly next to it. 
				What we need to test here is how far to the sides that is, as it could give us a false reading of the location of the car.
				<p>Similar tests must be done for infrared sensors. Infrared sensors have a determined range for where accuracy is considered reliable. 
				Below is a diagram of different kinds of infra red sensors and their maximum and minimum ranges:
				 </p>
				 <p><img src="img/infraredRanges.jpg"/> </p>
				 <p>What we need to do in terms of testing with infrared is to determine the ride height of cars
				 From there, we can choose the right kind of sensors who's minimum and maximum ranges fit that of the minimum and maximum ride heights of cars.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 Light sensors (or photodiodes) require some pretty advanced testing to ensure accurate results.
				 Since the implementation of this kind of sensor requires an advanced algorithm to determine the difference between a car being parked or not,
				 the algorithm needs to be tested to ensure that it can correctly tell if a car is parked in a bay or not. 
				 It needs to be able to detect changes in the environment and readjust its definition of a car being parked. 
				 Long periods of continuous readings will be necessary where cars will enter and leave the bay at random times during the day. 
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 A similar type of testing is required for the webcamera sensor. Again changes in the environment needs to be taken into consideration in the creation of the algorithm.
				 </p>
				 <p><h2> Data transmission </h2></p>
				 <p>To ensure that our data is being transmitted correctly, we need to do stress tests on the system. By sending different sized packages of information through our BlueTooth, 
				 ZigBee or WiFi transmitters, we can determine the capacity of our system. 
				 If we already know the speed of transmission possible for our transmitters, we can simulate different sized networks to see what is possible and what is the most efficient.</p>
